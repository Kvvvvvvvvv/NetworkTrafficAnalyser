## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Threat Intelligence API Keys
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_abuseipdb_key
OTX_API_KEY=your_otx_key
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_key

# GeoIP Service
IPINFO_TOKEN=your_ipinfo_token

# Local Country (for filtering)
LOCAL_COUNTRY=India
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   python app.py
   
   # Frontend (in another terminal)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the dashboard**:
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Test each feature**:
   - Go to the Threat Intelligence tab to see flagged IPs
