- Suspicious domain detection
- Reverse DNS lookup capabilities

### 8. VPN/Proxy/Tor Detection
- Identification of privacy-masked traffic
- VPN service detection
- Proxy and Tor network identification

### 9. Geo-time Correlation
- Timezone-based traffic analysis
- Off-hour activity detection
- Suspicious timing pattern identification

### 10. Network Path Tracing
- Traceroute functionality
- WHOIS lookup capabilities
- Network route visualization

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: Python Flask with WebSocket support
- **Packet Capture**: Scapy for real-time packet analysis
- **Database**: SQLite for historical data storage
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn for anomaly detection
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for all features

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with modern UI components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive design
- **Visualization**: Recharts and react-simple-maps
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Real-time**: WebSocket communication with backend

### Security Integrations
- **AbuseIPDB**: Malicious IP reputation scoring
- **ipinfo.io**: Geolocation and network information
- **OTX (AlienVault)**: Threat intelligence feeds
- **VirusTotal**: Malware and threat detection

## Key Components

### Backend API Endpoints
All 10 network-level features are accessible through dedicated API endpoints:
- `/api/get_flagged_ips`
- `/api/get_vpn_proxy_tor_detection`
- `/api/get_privacy_masked_ips`
- `/api/get_country_analytics`
- `/api/get_asn_isp_insights`
- `/api/get_port_protocol_intelligence`
- `/api/get_ip_clustering`
- `/api/get_dns_analytics`
- `/api/get_geo_time_correlation`
- `/api/network_path_trace`

### Frontend Components
Dedicated React components for each feature:
- `ThreatIntelligence.jsx`
- `FlaggedIPs.jsx`
- `PrivacyMaskedIPs.jsx`
- `CountryAnalytics.jsx`
- `AsnIspInsights.jsx`
- `PortProtocolIntelligence.jsx`
- `IpClustering.jsx`
- `DnsAnalytics.jsx`
- `GeoTimeCorrelation.jsx`
- `NetworkPathTracing.jsx`

## Verification Status
